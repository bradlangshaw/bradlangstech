            Hi, My name is Bradley Langshaw. I am from Ontario, and I have spent the last 7 years becoming a generalized software developer. I have spent this time working with and learning about many different coding languages. I grew up loving computer hardware and software. I do my best to build applications that work best on the end users hardware. I have also done some schooling in general business and travel and tourism. I am able to utilize my skills from all of these experiences to work on a team and better understand users, work with designers and understand client needs.
